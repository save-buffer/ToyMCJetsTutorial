# Solutions
 - RandomNumbers.py: Solution to assignment in beginning of section 3
   - Prints 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1, 1000 random numbers between
     5 and 15, 1000 random numbers according to a Gaussian distribution with
     mean 5 and standard deviation 2. Then prints 1000 numbers according to
     a Gaussian distribution with mean 5, standard deviation 2, and on the
     interval [0, 10]
 - Pi.py: Solution to assignment at the end of section 3.2
   - Approximates the value of Pi using the Monte-Carlo method. 
 - Sampling.py: Solution to assignment at the end of section 3.3
   Prints 1000 numbers using the Accept-Reject method, and using the inverse
   Accept-Reject method
 - PartonShower.py: Solution to sections 4 and 5
   - Simulates a 3D Parton Shower. Renders it in 3D using a weak perspective
     projection. Red and Blue indicate two different showers from two different
     particles from the collision. 
 - JetClustering.py: Solution to all of section 6
   - Simulates the parton shower in 3D and then clusters the shower into several
     jets. Prints the jets.
